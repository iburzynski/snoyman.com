## Haskell Success Program

## About me

* Found Haskell about 12 years ago
* Wanted a language that kept me honest
* Invested a lot of time into making Haskell a real commercial option
* Experienced personally and through others the difficulties in commercial Haskell adoption

---

## About FP Complete

* Founded by our CEO, Aaron Contorer, about 7 years ago
* Goal: help solve the [Global Software Crisis](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fpcomplete.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;12&#x2F;solving_the_software_crisis)
* Method: more functional programming, and Haskell in particular
* Result: lots of experience using Haskell in industry

---

## Haskell Success Program

* New initiative from FP Complete
* Provide an easy onramp option for companies interested in Haskell
* Offer the most common services necessary to help get past obstacles to adoption
* Provide educational material on **why Haskell**

More information at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;haskell.fpcomplete.com&#x2F;

---

## This talk is intended for

Developers&#x2F;team leads who:

* Are already (mostly) convinced of Haskell
* Want to understand better the business advantages
* Interested in what FP Complete can do to help

This talk will _not_ try to sell Haskell to you if you&#x27;re not already
bought in!

---

## Attractors and Obstacles

* Attractor: reason to do something
    * Skydiving is fun
    * Ice cream tastes good
    * Driving fast saves time
* Obstacles: reason _not_ to do something
    * I&#x27;m afraid of heights
    * It&#x27;s not healthy
    * I might crash

This model is central to our business approach

---

## Haskell&#x27;s attractors

We&#x27;ll cover some more later, but in brief

* Strong type system to make code more robust
* High level of developer productivity
* Great performance-to-SLOC ratio
* Scales nicely to large teams
* Large set of libraries

---

## Haskell&#x27;s obstacles

* Steep learning curve, especially for imperative&#x2F;OO programmers
* Smaller job pool &lt;=&gt; smaller hiring pool
* Less commercial support than the big languages
* Unclear onramping
* Some gaps in tooling (especially IDEs)
* Difficult to convince others of the value of Haskell

Primary goal of the Haskell Success Program: knock down these obstacles!

---

## Haskell&#x27;s 80% rule

* 80% of Haskell gives you 80% of the benefits
* Huge value-add by simply using Haskell 98
* We can sometimes forget how much power ADTs and typeclasses bring
* Overuse of more advanced features can be a deterrent to Haskell&#x27;s adoption
    * Steeper learning curve
    * Abandoned project fear

---

## Learning Haskell for its own sake

* Haskell is arguably the best way to learn functional programming
* FP is well accepted in industry today
* Want to write more functional Javascript? Start by learning Haskell

---

## You need a pilot project

* Don&#x27;t convert your whole codebase over to Haskell on day 1!
* Choose a small, standalone project that plays to Haskell&#x27;s strengths
* Usually networked service
* Leverage concurrency
* Complex business logic
* Not a lot of integration with existing systems
* Pilot project is crucical to the learning process, otherwise the team will forget everything

---

## But why Haskell?

* Maintainable software
    * More info https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DdR9q69se-I
* Performance- not the best, but usually a factor of 2 from the best
* Productive- get your project to market quickly
* High bug resilience (see next slide)

---

## Better than I could put it...

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Strong, static types don’t prevent all bugs. They just prevent whole classes of annoying, avoidable bugs. So you can focus on the really hard bugs: spec bugs, design bugs, UX bugs. That’s incredibly valuable!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Morabijn (@morabbin) &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;morabbin&#x2F;status&#x2F;1122085849502449665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 27, 2019&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platform.twitter.com&#x2F;widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;

---

## Particularly strong domains

We&#x27;ve found that the following are good points to lead with

* Concurrency (async&#x2F;STM&#x2F;explicit effects&#x2F;immutability)
* Parsers (lightweight syntax&#x2F;`do`-notation)
* Streaming data
* Property testing

---

## Haskell does fine

Don&#x27;t claim Haskell does this better than everyone else, but it&#x27;s good
enough

* Web server&#x2F;client
* Unit testing (purity arguably makes this strong)
* Library coverage (though missing some domain-specific things from
  JVM&#x2F;.NET&#x2F;Python worlds)

---

## Where Haskell _doesn&#x27;t_ shine

Acknowledge that not everything in Haskell is great

* GUI and frontend web development
* Don&#x27;t start with category theory! Not needed, scares people away
* Async exceptions are a pain
* IDE support

---

## How FP Complete can help

* Training
* Consulting on pilot projects
* Set up new projects
* Recommend best practices
* Code review
* Pair programming
* Advising on hiring

---

## Be successful with Haskell!

* Happy to help however we can
* We love seeing more Haskell adoption in the world

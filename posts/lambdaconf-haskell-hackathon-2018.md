On June 6, 2018, I'll be running a Haskell Hackathon as a Mini-Conf
after LambdaConf. I've started a
[Github repo](https://github.com/snoyberg/haskell-hackathon#readme)
for preparing for this hackathon, and I'd like to ask for people to
contribute, whether or not you'll be attending the hackathon.

My goal with this repository is to provide a way for people
maintaining open source projects to submit work items that they would
like help with, and which they believe could be tackled by a new
contributor within the course of a day (or less!). Note that these
don't necessarily need to be beginner-level tasks, but the issue
tracker does ask you to indicate the skill level you think is needed.

If you have such a task, please
[submit it as an issue](https://github.com/snoyberg/haskell-hackathon/issues/new).

And of course: if you're going to be at LambdaConf, or otherwise will
be in or around Boulder on that date, you're warmly welcome to attend
and participate in this hackathon. It will be a great opportunity to
dive in to the open source Haskell ecosystem, meet other Haskellers,
get some guidance, and/or mentor others. If anyone has questions,
please feel free to reach out in the comments below or elsewhere. Hope
to see you there!

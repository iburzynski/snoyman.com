A few weeks back I
[proposed a reskin of conduit](http://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/09/proposed-conduit-reskin)
to make it easier to learn and use. The proposal overall got broad
support, and therefore I went ahead with it. I then spent some time
(quite a bit more than expected) updating the conduit tutorial to use
this new reskin. If you're interested in conduit or streaming data in
Haskell, please take a look at the new version.

* [haskell-lang version](https://haskell-lang.org/library/conduit)
* [Raw Github version](https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit/blob/master/README.md)

Thanks to all who provided feedback. Also, if you want to provide some
more feedback, there's one more Github issue open up:
[RFC: Stop using the type synonyms in library type signatures](https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit/issues/283). Please
feel free to share your opinions/add a reaction/start a flame war.

And yes, the flame war comment is a joke. Please don't take that one
literally.

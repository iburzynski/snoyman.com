Yesterday on Twitter, a lot of people were interested in
[the multiday fast I'm currently doing](https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/1016312409760436225). Since
I'm awake at 4am (more on that below), now seems like a great time to
explain a bit about the fasting. I will drop the major caveat at the
start: I am in no way an expert on fasting. For that, you'd want
[Dr. Jason Fung](https://twitter.com/drjasonfung), and likely his book
[The Complete Guide to Fasting](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Fasting-Intermittent-Alternate-Day/dp/1628600012). This
will be my personal anecdotes version of that information.

There are many reasons to consider fasting, including:

* __Religious reasons__. As many know, I'm a religious Jew, so this
  concept is not at all foreign to me, and probably helped me more
  easily get into fasting. However, that's _not_ my motivation today,
  or related to the rest of this blog post.
* __Losing weight__. It's pretty hard to put on weight when you're not
  eating anything. (But you probably wanted to
  [burn fat, not muscle](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2017/06/naive-overview-nutrition-exercise),
  right?)
* __Mental clarity__. Many people&mdash;myself included&mdash;report
  feelings of clear-mindedness and focus during a fast. I find I get
  some of my best writing and coding done when fasting.
* __Extra energy__. This may seem counter-intuitive: where's the energy
  coming from? We'll get to that.
* __General health benefits__. Fasting has been well demonstrated to
  help treat epilepsy, but more recently also have claims of
  anti-cancer benefits. It can also be a highly effective treatment
  for type 2 diabetes.

Alright, let's get into the details of how to do this.

## Caveats

I'll get this out of the way right now. I am not a doctor. I cannot
give you health advice. I'm telling you about what works for me, a
decently healthy person without preexisting conditions. If you are
taking medication, _especially_ insulin or anything that affects your
blood sugar, talk with a doctor before doing this, or at the very
least read one of Dr. Fung's books.

## How to fast

The process is simple: stop eating. This isn't a "bread and water"
fast. This isn't a "maple syrup and cayenne pepper" fast (worst TED
talk I've ever seen by the way, I refuse to link to it). You are
consuming virtually no calories. (We'll get to virtually in a second.)

You _should_ continue drinking water, and lots of it. Drinking green
tea is helpful too, and black and herbal teas are fine. There's also
no problem with coffee. In fact: the caffeine in coffee can help you
burn fat, which will help the fast progress more easily.

You should _not_ drink any sugary drinks. (That's not just advice for
a fast, that's advice for life too.) You should probably avoid
artificial sweeteners as well, since they can cause an insulin spike,
and some contain calories.

There are three other things you can include in your fast if desired:

* Salts, including sodium (normal table salt), potassium, and
  magnesium. Personally, I've used a bit of normal table salt,
  himalayan salt, or high-potassium salt.
    * If you're wondering: how do you consume the salt? Yup: I drink
      salt water sometimes. Delicious.
* Some cream in your coffee. Don't overdo it: you're not making
  bulletproof coffee here. This is intended to just take some of the
  edge off of your coffee if you can't stand black coffee.
* Bone broth, essentially beef (or other) bones cooking in a crockpot
  with salt for 24 hours straight. This is a nice way to get in some
  salts, a few other trace minerals, and give you a satisfied feeling
  before going to sleep.

The latter two _do_ contribute some calories, almost entirely from
fat. Don't overdo this, you'll be counteracting the point of the
fast. And definitely avoid getting protein or any carbs mixed in; do
not eat some of the meat off the bones, or throw in carrots or other
starchy vegetables.

If you're doing a fast for anti-cancer reasons, I've read that you
should eliminate the cream and broth as well, and _maybe_ consider
leaving out the coffee and even tea. Again: I'm not an expert here,
and I've never tried that kind of fast.

## When to fast

Fasting does not require any preparation. Just decide to do it, and
stop eating! I typically like to stop eating around 6pm one day, and
see how many days I can go before I cave in and eat. I'll mention some
reasons to cave in below.

My maximum fasting time is currently four days. It's doubtful I'll
ever get beyond six days due to the weekly Jewish Sabbath, but that's
currently my goal. If you're doing a multiday fast, I'd recommend
targeting at least three days, since the second day is by far the
hardest (from personal experience, and what I've read), and you should
see it through till it gets easier.

By the way, the world record longest fast is 382 days. The rules for
fasting change a bit at that point, and you would need to take
vitamins and minerals to make it through.

## Hunger

The biggest fear people have is _hunger_. This is a normal, natural
reaction. As someone who has done fasts plenty of times, I still
sometimes feel the fear of being hungry. Allow me to share some
personal experience.

When I'm in the middle of eating food, the thought of purposely
witholding from eating is terrifying. Once I've stopped eating for
half a day or so, that terror seems in retrospect to be completely
irrational. I strongly believe that I, like many others, can react
with an almost chemical addiction-like response to food. It's nice to
occassionally break that dependence.

Many people assume that they'll be overcome with hunger once they've
gone somewhere around 8 hours without eating. I'd recommend thinking
of it as a challenge: can you handle not eating? Your body is built to
withstand times of no food, you'll be fine. This is a straight
mind-over-matter moment.

Another concern many have is memories of trying to diet, and feeling
miserable the whole time. Let me relate that it is _significantly
easier_ to spend a day not eating anything, and another day eating
normally, than it is to spend two days eating less. The simple
decision to not eat at all is massively simplifying.

## Relationship to ketosis

When most people hear "keto," they're thinking of a diet plan that
involves eating an absurd amount of bacon with an occassional
avocado. In reality, ketosis is a state in the body where your liver
is generating ketone bodies for energy. Here's the gist of it:

* The two primary fuel sources for the body are fat and carbs
  (sugar/glucose)
* Most of your body can happily use either of these
* However, fat cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, so your brain
  typically runs exclusively on glucose
* When you dramatically restrict your carb intake (and to some extent
  your protein intake), your body has insufficient glucose to run your
  brain
* Instead: your liver will convert fat into ketones, which is an
  alternate energy source your body, and in particular your brain, can
  use

I'm honestly a bit unsure of the whole topic of proteins in ketosis,
as I've read conflicting information. But the basic idea of
restricting carbs is straightforward. One way to do this is to eat a
very-high-fat diet. But another approach is to _eat nothing at
all_. The same process will take place in your body, and you'll end up
in ketosis, likely faster than with a ketogenic diet.

At this point, your whole body will be running off of a combination of
ketones and fats, with a small amount of sugar circulating for some
cells which can only run on glucose. This explains some of the
purported benefits I mentioned above:

* Running your brain on a different energy source can give you mental
  focus. This is _not_ universal: some people report no such feeling.
* Once you switch over to ketosis on a fast, you're burning your
  (likely ample) body fat stores, providing a nearly-unlimited supply
  of raw calories. Compare this to having 3 meals a day: you are
  typically dependent on each meal to provide your energy, and are
  just waiting for your next infusion of food for a pick-me-up.
* Using your body fat as a fuel source obviously means you'll be
  burning fat, which is the right way to lose weight! But
  fasting+ketosis does something even better: it trains your body to
  be better at burning fat, making it easier to continue burning fat
  in the future.

One final note: people familiar with Type 1 diabetes may be terrified
of the term "keto" due to ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a dangerous
medical condition, and does involve ketones. However, it is _not_ the
same state as ketosis, and being in ketosis is not dangerous. (But
remember my caveats about not being a doctor above, especially if you
_are_ a type 1 diabetic.)

## Exercise

My personal approach to exercise on a fast is:

* Follow my normal lifting routine
* Try to train as hard and heavy as I can, accepting that the lack of
  incoming food _will_ make me a bit weaker.
* Schedule a lifting session at the very beginning of the fast,
  followed by a High Internsity Interval Training (HIIT) session. I
  still have plenty of energy and glycogen stores to get me through
  this session on the first day, and the session helps drain those
  glycogen stores and kick me into ketosis faster.

For weight lifting, I follow an RPE-based program, which essentially
adjusts the weight on the bar to how hard it feels. Therefore, as I
progress through the fast, I can typically continue following the same
program, but the weight I lift will naturally go down a bit.

Side note: at the time of writing this blog post, I'm recovering from
wrist tendonitis, and was already deloaded in my lifting, which is why
I'm not lifting hard. It's not because of the fast, but it _is_
affecting how I'm responding to the fast most likely.

## Side effects

There are some side effects to fasting worth mentioning, including why
I'm writing this blog post now:

* __Insomnia__. For me, the ketone rush seems to disrupt my sleep
  cycle. I don't actually feel tired during the day, so maybe this is
  a good thing.
* I won't do it justice, but Dr. Fung describes many __hormonal
  changes__ that occur when you're in a fasted state. These include
  things like increased human growth hormone and insulin-like growth
  factor 1. The upshot of this is that you should **experience _less_
  protein and muscle wasting** during a fast than when following a
  calorite-restricted diet.
    * This is the primary reason I'm doing the multiday fast right
      now: I've been on a "cut" for a few months and unhappy with the
      amount of muscle loss I've had. I want to finish up the cut
      quickly and get back into maintenance mode eating, without
      incurring greater muscle loss. I intend to continue
      experimenting into the future with using multiday fasts as
      mini-cuts.
* __Nausea__. The first time I did a multiday fast, I got so nauseous
  that by the end of the third day I had to break the fast. It was bad
  enough that I couldn't stand the taste of coffee for the next two
  months. However, that first fast included no cream or bone
  broth. Since I've added those two things, I haven't had any more
  nausea when fasting.
* __Dizziness__. Especially when first adapting to the fasted state,
  you may feel lightheaded. Just be careful, and be sure to drink
  enough water, and supplement salts as needed. More generally: make
  sure you get enough fluids.

There are certainly others, these are just the ones that have most
affected me.

## Ending the fast

I've ended the fast in the past because I either felt sick, or because
of some personal obligation where I didn't want to be "compromised" in
a fasted state. (This was likely just a cop-out on my part, going on a
4 hour trip with a group of fourth graders isn't _that_ taxing.) I
would recommend setting a goal for how long you want to try to fast
for, and be ready to be flexible with that goal (either longer or
shorter) depending on how you're responding.

I don't really have any great recommendations on what to break your
fast with. However, you may want to continue eating a low carb or
ketogenic diet. You've just put yourself into a deep state of ketosis,
which many people struggle to do. May as well take advantage of it!

This may not be universal, and I won't go into details, but expect
some GI distress after the fast ends. Your digestive system has been
off duty for a few days, it needs to reboot.

## Recommendations

Alright, so that was a lot of information all over the place. You're
probably wondering: what should _I_ do? Frankly, you can do whatever
you want! You can choose to dive in at the deep end and start off
immediately with a multiday fast. Dr. Fung mentions this in his
book. However, in my own experience, I started much more gradually:

* Low carb and ketogenic diets
* Intermittent fasting: only eating between 12pm and 8pm, for example
* Experience with religious fasts
* Randomly skipping meals
* A 24-hour fast (stop eating at 6pm, eat the next day at 6pm)
* A multiday fast

Keep in mind: many people in the world today have never skipped a
meal. Consider starting with something as easy as not having breakfast
to prove to yourself that you don't need to consume calories all
waking hours of the day.

If you have questions you'd like me to answer in a follow up post,
either on fasting, or other related health topics, let me know in the
comments below or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/snoyberg).

## Extra: muscle loss

I'm not going to claim that fasting is the miracle that allows us to
gain muscle and lose fat. I don't have enough personal experience to
vouch for that even in my own body, and the research I've seen is
conflicted on the topic. As I love doing n=1 experiments on myself, I
intend to do more tests with fasting following periods of moderate
over eating to see what happens.

## Extra: some calorie math

For anyone in a healthy or above weight range, your body is carrying more
than enough calories in fat to sustain you for days, likely weeks. If
you do some quick math: there are 3,500 calories in 1 pound (0.45 kg)
of fat. If you burn about 2,000 calories a day, you can burn roughly
half a pound (.22kg) of fat a day. A 165 pound (70kg) person at 20%
bodyfat would have 115,500 calories in fat storage, enough to survive
over 55 days. Point being: once you've entered the ketosis stage of
your fast, you essentially have unlimited energy stores available to
use, as opposed to needing another hit from a meal to recharge.

## Extra: anti-cancer

To be a broken record: I'm not an expert on this topic. But the basic
idea of anti-cancer claims for fasting come down to starving out the
cancer cells. Cancer cells require lots of glucose (and a bit of
protein) for energy. Fasting starves out the cancer cells. I'm not
telling anyone to skip chemo or radiation. But I do personally know
someone who defeated breast cancer with an (I believe) 11 day fast.

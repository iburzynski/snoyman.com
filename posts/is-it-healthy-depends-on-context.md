Some relevant backstory: I've been experimenting quite a bit over the
past 6 months to see how I respond to different eating
patterns. Included in that have been a few months of high carb
consumption, focusing mostly on starches as an energy source. However,
I'm generally in a low-carb mode, and my family are pretty familiar
with that. With that information...

A family member recently asked me why oatmeal is healthy. The question
makes sense: if I typically avoid carbohydrates, why would
oatmeal&mdash;a food I ate quite a bit of during that high carb
phase&mdash;be a healthy choice?

In that conversation, I introduced the concept of _context_ for
diet. This isn't a novel concept I've come up with, but I wanted to
explain it here anyway. Let's start off with the extreme versions of
this.

"Is sugar healthy?" I've written plenty here already claiming that
sugar is _not_ healthy. However, if someone is about to die due to
lack of sufficient calories, sugar would be _very_ healthy (it will
prevent imminent death).

Which is healthier: a cheeseburger or a cucumber? Most people probably
think the cucumber. In the context of modern Western disease, where
overconsumption is rampant, the cucumber is probably
healthier. However, the cheeseburger includes more micronutrients, and
for someone with a deficiency may be considered healthier.

Coming back to the oatmeal. When I was following a high carb diet, I
considered oatmeal a healthy choice (others may disagree). I was
eating a whole grain, so taking in significant fiber with the
starch. To my knowledge, I have no insulin resistance, and therefore
can tolerate carbohydrates well. Oatmeal is satiating, making it less
likely that I would overeat it. And it provides a decent amount of
protein, something which I was looking for in my context (significant
resistance training).

Right now, I'm eating a ketogenic diet. If I was to eat a bowl of
oatmeal, it would kick me out of ketosis and spike my insulin. All of
that fat that I'm eating during this keto phase would likely end up
getting stored as body fat, something I'm trying to avoid. It would be
a terrible idea.

Similarly, during that high carb phase, if I'd eaten a super-high-fat
meal like I do right now, most of that fat would have gone to storage
instead of to providing my body's energy needs.

Keep this in mind when making nutrition choices. Even if someone else
who is highly health conscious is eating it, it may not be the right
choice for you. Make sure to analyze:

* Your goals (gain weight, perform in the gym, etc)
* Any specific aspects of your body (autoimmune, insulin resistance,
  current weight, etc) relevant to the decision
* What activities you're performing (someone with a desk job doesn't
  need as many calories as a marathon runner)
* What the rest of your diet looks like

Also, if you're vegan, vegetarian, or keep kosher, that cheeseburger I
mentioned above is probably _always_ a bad choice.

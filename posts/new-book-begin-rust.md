Miriam (aka [@LambdaMom](https://twitter.com/LambdaMom)) and I are very happy to announce the release of [Begin Rust](https://www.beginrust.com/). We've been working on this book since the end of last year, and we're very excited to release it to the world.

Begin Rust is a complete guide to programming with the Rust programming language, targeted at new and experienced programmers alike.

We started working on the content in this book when trying to teach our children some programming. We eventually decided to expand it to a full introduction. We've strived to make the content accessible to younger audiences who have less experience with computers. We hope it can also be useful for experienced programmers looking to learn about the Rust programming language.

The [first three chapters are available online](https://www.beginrust.com/sample/beginrust.html) if you'd like to see them. We also have a [Discourse instance for discussion](https://chat.beginrust.com/) and [a @beginrust Twitter account](https://twitter.com/beginrust).

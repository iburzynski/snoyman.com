**Heads up** This blog post series has been updated and published as an eBook by FP Complete. I'd recommend reading that version instead of these posts. If you're interested, please check out the [Rust Crash Course eBook](https://www.fpcomplete.com/rust/crash-course/).

Below are the solutions to the exercises from the last Rust Crash
Course lesson, "Lifetimes and slices."

This post is part of a series based on [teaching Rust at FP
Complete](https://www.fpcomplete.com/rust). If you're reading this post outside
of the blog, you can find links to all posts in the series [at the top of the
introduction
post](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2018/10/introducing-rust-crash-course). You

## Exercise 1

If you try just throwing in the `ref` keyword like this:

```rust
match person.age {
    Some(ref age) => {
        println!("Age is {}", age);
        *age += 1;
    }
    None => println!("No age provided"),
}
```

You'll get an error message:

```
error[E0594]: cannot assign to immutable borrowed content `*age`
  --> src/main.rs:16:13
   |
14 |         Some(ref age) => {
   |              ------- help: use a mutable reference instead: `ref mut age`
15 |             println!("Age is {}", age);
16 |             *age += 1;
   |             ^^^^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable
```

Instead, you need to say `ref mut age`. And if you're like me and
regularly type in `mut ref age` instead of `ref mut age`, don't worry,
the compiler's got your back:

```
error: the order of `mut` and `ref` is incorrect
  --> src/main.rs:14:14
   |
14 |         Some(mut ref age) => {
   |              ^^^^^^^ help: try switching the order: `ref mut`

error: aborting due to previous error
```

## Exercise 2

You need to provide mutable references for the two arguments to
`swap`. Additionally, in order to get a mutable reference to `res`,
`res` itself needs to be `mut`able.

```rust
fn next(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
    let mut res = None;
    std::mem::swap(&mut res, &mut self.next);
    res
}
```

## Exercise 3

We need to have two different parameters, and ensure that `ret` and
the return value have the same lifetime parameter:

```rust
fn message_and_return<'a, 'b>(msg: &'a String, ret: &'b String) -> &'b String {
    println!("Printing the message: {}", msg);
    ret
}
```

## Exercise 4

Since the data is stored in the program executable itself, it lives
for the entire program execution. Therefore, the lifetime is
`'static`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let bytearray1: &'static [u8; 22] = b"Hello World in binary!";
    let bytearray2: &'static [u8] = b"Hello World in binary!";
    println!("{:?}", bytearray1);
    println!("{:?}", bytearray2);
}
```

## Exercise 5

This is a great use case for the iterator method `count`:

```rust
fn main() {
    for arg in std::env::args() {
        println!(
            "arg: {}, characters: {}, bytes: {}",
            arg,
            arg.chars().count(),
            arg.bytes().count(),
            );
    }
}
```

Just a minor note: I'm planning on starting up this blog again, with some
personal thoughts - likely still mostly around programming and Haskell - that
don't fit in the other blogs that I contribute to ([Yesod Web
Framework](http://www.yesodweb.com) and [FP
Complete](https://www.fpcomplete.com)).

I don't have a clear list of topics I'm going to be covering, but I'll likely
be sharing some thoughts on running engineering teams and startups effectively.
If you have something you'd like me to cover, please [Tweet it to
me](https://twitter.com/snoyberg).

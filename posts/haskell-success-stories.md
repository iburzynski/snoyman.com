I've probably blogged, spoken, Tweeted, and commented on a variation
on this theme many times in the past, so please excuse me for being a
broken record. This is important.

I think we have a problem in the Haskell community. We all know that
using Haskell to create a simple web service, a CRUD app, a
[statically linked command line tool](https://twitter.com/pdxleif/status/855302710928613376),
or a dozen other things is not only possible, but commonplace,
trivial, and not even noteworthy. So we don't bother commenting when
we create
[general purpose reverse proxy tools](https://github.com/fpco/wai-middleware-crowd)
with
[prebuilt Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/fpco/wai-crowd/) for
auth-enabling arbitrary webapps. It's boring. Unfortunately, __people
outside our community don't know this__. By not bothering to talk
about this (for us) boring topic, we're hiding away the fact that
Haskell is a practical language for creating real things.

Instead, we like to talk about
[better preludes](http://www.snoyman.com/blog/2017/01/safe-prelude-a-thought-experiment),
[optimizing common functions](http://www.snoyman.com/blog/2017/01/foldable-mapm-maybe-and-recursive-functions),
or
[dangers in our standard libraries](http://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/12/beware-of-readfile). I'm
picking on myself here with these examples, but my comments apply far
more generally.

I know personally at least 10-15 Haskell success stories that have
never been talked about publicly. And I have to apologize for not
leading by example here; unfortunately most of my work in the past few
years has either been under NDA, or been of absolutely no interest to
people outside the Haskell community (usually open source
infrastructure and libraries). So I'm hoping to inspire others to step
up to the plate.

I'm not trying to tell anyone to stop talking about the things we find
interesting. I just want to point out that just because we, within the
Haskell community, may not find a "I launched a web service, and it's
running, and it's not as buggy as we would have expected v1 to be"
kind of blog post noteworthy, I think others _will_. These kinds of
blog posts are also a much easier way to get started talking publicly
about Haskell, since not all of us can explain zygohistomorphic
prepomorphisms (I know I certainly can't).

As I was batting the idea for this post around with
[my wife](https://twitter.com/LambdaMom) last night, she pointed out
that, most likely, the people best suited to write these kinds of
posts may not have dedicated blogs at all right now. If you fall into
that category, but would still be interested in writing up a post
about your Haskell success story, I'd like to offer assistance. I'm
happy to let guests write posts on the
[Yesod blog](http://www.yesodweb.com/blog). Articles may also be
relevant to [haskell-lang.org](https://haskell-lang.org). And we've
run Haskell experience reports on
[FP Complete's website](https://www.fpcomplete.com) many times in the
past.

I hope this time around this message had a bit of a different twist,
and maybe can hit a different group of readers.

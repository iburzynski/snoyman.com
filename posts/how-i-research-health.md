I'd like to present two fairly straightforward points:

* I've written multiple blog posts on health related topics
* I have absolutely no formal training on the topic, and there's no
  reason people should take my blog posts as authoratative

That said, I continue to write these blog posts, share information
with friends and family, and make decisions for myself. How do I
reconcile this? How do I approach the truly terrifying level of
contradictory information available in the health/nutrition/exercise
landscape? How do I want other people reading content from me to
relate to it, given that I'm a self-acknowledged non-expert?

I strongly believe that the biggest hurdle for people to adopt healthy
lifestyle choices these days is knowing where to begin (with willpower
to do so in second place). Are you supposed to follow low carb, or low
fat? Jog, or sprint? Body weight training, or free weights?

In general, this is similar to the [Paradox of
Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice), only
worse: not only can you become paralyzed by the sheer number of
options out there, but you can _also_ be paralyzed by the fact that
different sources will claim that each alternative _will actively harm
you_. Given that landscape, it's only natural for people to walk away
saying "the experts are just going to change their minds in 10 years,
there's no point trying to make changes to my lifestyle." And I should
know: I felt that way for years.

## My process

Having established my credentials as a non-expert in this field,
here's how I've approached gathering knowledge and making decisions on
the topics:

* __Trust very little.__ If "experts" can completely contradict each
  other, blindly trusting "experts" is impossible. You'll end up on a
  low-fat, low-carb, vegan, carnivore diet. In other words, you'll
  starve yourself to death. Except the experts _also_ say not to use
  fasting.
* __Listen to everything.__ This may sound contradictory to my
  previous point, but it's not. You should read, listen to podcasts,
  watch videos, and consume any other content from as varied a set of
  sources as you can. Take them all into account, but don't _blindly
  trust_ anything. Look for patterns in the recommendations. Pay
  attention to the inconsistencies. Watch for trends. This may help
  guide you towards some relatively uncontroversial opinions (e.g.,
  "avoid processed foods," "don't eat unless you're hungry"), and help
  you understand better what the current debates are all about.
* __Dig into the sources.__ This stage is honestly optional, but I
  find it enjoyable because I like this stuff. Having understood where
  the "authorities" are arguing, look at their sources, and others
  they don't provide. Read nutrition studies and reviews. It may help
  you understand how those "authorities" are misrepresenting some
  facts, for example. Accept the fact that even these primary sources
  are going to contradict, but see if you can parse through the
  contradictions. Example: it's very common for "low carb" studies to
  come up with vastly different results; pay attention to if they're
  using the same definition of "low carb."
* __Experiment on yourself.__ Sample size 1 experiments without a
  double blind control aren't real science. Fair enough. But they do
  tell you a lot about your own body and how you respond. Even if it's
  the placebo effect, it's still an effect. If you get a headache
  every time you eat X, even if all of the studies say it helps with
  headaches... maybe don't eat X. (Intentionally not giving a concrete
  example, I don't want to cause a placebo effect in anyone.)
    * One caveat I always feel obligated to restate: __I am not a
      doctor__. My advice is just the advice of someone who doesn't
      know anything. If you have medical conditions, or specific
      medical instructions, I am __absolutely not telling you to
      ignore them__.


## My sources

My sources of information these days tend towards voices in the low
carb and barbell training communities. More on how I ended up here a
bit below. As I said above, I'd strongly recommend gathering _many_
different sources. And even if you disagree with one side (e.g.,
you're either pro- or anti-vegan), I suggest finding the best sources
on each side that you can.

Here are some of the sources I read or listen to.

* [Dr Jason Fung](https://twitter.com/drjasonfung). I've read two of
  his books:
* [Barbell Medicine](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/)
* [Starting Strength](https://startingstrength.com/)
* [What I've Learned](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYPhGiB9tkShZorfgcL2lA)
* [Mark's Daily Apple](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/). In
  particular, his "Weekend Link Love" Sunday post is a _wonderful_
  collection of links.
* [Jeff Nippard](https://www.youtube.com/user/icecream4PRs/featured)
* Dr Robert Lustig's [Sugar: The Bitter Truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM)
* [Low Carb Down Under](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcTTiHZtNpiqD2EubIO5HFw)

And books I've read and recommend:

* The Obesity Code
* The Complete Guide to Fasting
* The Hungry Brain
* The Case Against Sugar
* The Secret Life of Fat

Some notes on these:

* The Hungry Brain and The Case Against Sugar are in many ways
  contradictory. However, as I'll mention below, I think they can
  complement each other.
* I got less out of The Complete Guide to Fasting than I expected. It
  was interesting and motivational, but I was already motivated to try
  fasting. If you want to know _why_ you should try fasting, read
  it. If you just want to do it: feel free to just fast :)
* Similarly, The Secret Life of Fat was more theoretical on topics I
  was less interested in, and didn't lend much on the practical
  side. Still a good collection of information.

## My filters

There's a huge amount of information out there. It's simply not
humanly possible to read everything, experiment with everything,
etc. You'll need to ultimately install some filters to help you parse
through the information. Here are some I use:

* I like to be educated on a topic. But if it doesn't affect me
  personally, or I'm happy with my approach for the moment, I'll stop
  focusing on it.
* I believe sources are biased. This applies to me (as I tried to
  point out a bit above, and will do more so of soon). As a religious
  Jew, I use this example: if a Rabbi told me that eating pork was
  unhealthy, I would distrust him. I believe there's quite a bit of
  that in the health space, where moral arguments end up influencing,
  for example, complete avoidance of animal products or using only
  humanely raised products. I'm not going to comment here on the moral
  arguments at all, but I will say that I think they bias many
  proponents. Similarly, people who have made a career on advocating a
  certain dietary or exercise approach will have a vested interest in
  continue to espouse it, despite new evidence contradicting.

  We can't eliminate this bias, it's human nature. My best advice, and
  what I try to do, is to identify it, and weigh arguments. When
  possible, I try to find less-biased sources on topics, such as [Jeff
  Nippard's video on vegan diet
  science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qoyoItiB1E).
* After I get into a rut of a specific approach, I try to force myself
  to listen to contradicting views again. It's enlightening to see how
  I will react negatively on hearing the arguments. I try hard to
  force myself to get past my own biases and judge the information on
  its own. Basically: when I listen to a video or read a
  post/article/book, I try to turn off my falsehood filter
  temporarily, absorb the information, and only analyze its veracity
  after the fact.

I'm currently actively looking for information sources which are more
positive of high-carb and vegan eating approaches. The sources I've
found so far typically have been too moralistic (eating animals is
bad) or authoritarian (all major organizations support what we say)
for my taste. I'd be happy if people want to leave some
recommendations below.

## My biases

This section is mostly irrelevant, but for those curious, I want to be
more explicit about my current biases:

* I believe resistance training is overall more important to health
  than cardio. Of resistance training, I believe weight training is
  easier to improve with than bodyweights or resistance bands. And of
  weight training, freeweights (barbells in particular) give the best
  results, though require significant effort in learning the form. And
  you'll never beat deadlifts for back problems.
* Sugar is the worst part of our diets today. You should avoid it like
  the plague. I'm mixed on artificial sweeteners.
* Vegetable oil is almost as bad as sugar.
* Both low carb and low fat work really well. But overall, low carb is
  easier to lose weight with and adhere to.
* The simple rule of "no processed foods" will solve about 80% of diet
  problems, if you include sugar, vegetable oil, and refined grains as
  processed foods.
* Fasting (intermittent, multiday, etc), are healthy. Not only are
  they good *physically*, but more importantly they prove to yourself
  that you're stronger than you think.
* While hormones are an important part of obesity, and likely the
  prime factor (constantly high insulin), the approach in "The Hungry
  Brain" of highly palatable foods/food reward causing overconsumption
  of calories seems to be a factor. (I might even say it's _obviously_
  a factor.) Despite much public attention, I don't see the hormone
  and food reward hypotheses as completely conflicting, and believe
  both should be paid attention to for optimizing health.

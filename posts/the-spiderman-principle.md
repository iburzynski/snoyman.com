#### *With great power comes great responsibility*

I was
[recently reminded](https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/880637139574304769)
of a bit of a mantra that I had at LambdaConf this year in
discussions, and I decided to share it here. I received a bunch of
questions like these (I'd share the originals, but I have a terrible
memory):

* Why is there no tutorial for doing X?
* Why doesn't a library like Y exist?
* Why has no one created a mailing list/discussion forum/etc for topic
  Z?

The answer to all of these is the same: __because you haven't done
it!__ And I don't mean that in the plural "you" or figuratively. The
one and only reason why things don't get done is because you,
personally, individually, have not done them.

This of course isn't literally true. There's a possibility that
someone else will step up to the plate first. And there are limited
numbers of hours in the day, and no one person can accomplish
everything. But this mindset is, in my opinion, the only correct one
to adopt if you want things to happen. It's your responsibility to do
it; don't wait for others to do it.

You may have some legitimate objections to this philosophy:

* *How can I write a tutorial, I don't understand how to accomplish
  this?*

    * Go ahead and write it as best you can, and ask people to review
      it. People are usually quite happy to provide corrections and
      advice.
    * A streamlined way of doing this is to send a pull request to an
      existing repo holding documentation (e.g.,
      [haskell-lang](https://github.com/haskell-lang/haskell-lang#contributing-content)).
    * Worst case scenario: ask questions. Encourage people to write up
      answers. Volunteer to compose the answers into a coherent
      document at the end. Even people not willing to participate in
      writing a full tutorial themselves may be quite happy to answer
      direct questions, especially knowing their work will be
      preserved for others.

* *How can I write such a library, it's beyond my capabilities?*

    * You'd be surprised about that. Give it a shot. Worst case
      scenario: it'll be a learning experience and otherwise an epic
      failure. Best case scenario: you succeed. Either way, it's a
      win-win situation.
    * Maybe your desired functionality fits into an existing
      library. Library authors tend to be quite happy to review and
      accept pull requests, and contributing an extra function can be
      less intimidating than writing a new library. (But please
      consider
      [opening an issue first](/blog/2017/06/how-to-send-me-a-pull-request?preview=true).)
    * And if you're certain you're not up to the task: try to
      encourage others. You may not succeed. But try to make the case
      for why this project is useful, interesting, necessary, or
      whatever other adjectives you believe apply. Motivate people.

* *I'm not a community leader, how can I encourage discussions?*

    * There's no such thing as an "official" community leader. There
      are people with moderator access on some forums or control over
      certain websites. But that's not what makes someone a leader. If
      people want to hear what you have to say and join the
      conversation, you're leading a conversation.
    * Besides, you don't need to be a leader to start a discussion.
    * A slight retraction to all of this: if a topic has already been
      beaten to death, it's almost certainly not worth rehashing
      it. Reraising controversial points constantly doesn't help
      anyone.

* *It doesn't seem like the community agrees on this point, how can I advocate it?*

    * Just because many people seem to be advocating X does not mean
      that it is universally held. There are many reasons why X seems
      to be the dominant viewpoint:

        * People may be legitimately unaware of alternatives
        * The people who disagree with X all think it's not worth
          speaking against the "dominant" opinion
        * The people who believe X are simply more passionate about it
          than those that don't.

    * So what if people disagree? Having healthy technical debate is a
      _good thing_. There are at least three outcomes I can see from
      such a debate:

        * You realize you were wrong
        * People disagreeing with you realize they were wrong
        * Both sides continue with their beliefs, but have a deeper
          understanding of both their positions and the alternatives

    * But again, try to avoid beating a topic to death

I don't know if people outside the Haskell world experience this as
much as we do. But I've certainly seen a strong sentiment of "not
being worthy" or some other such idea. It's rubbish. Join the
conversation, lead the way, make things happen. The world will be
better for it.

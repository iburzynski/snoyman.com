I've been giving this topic a lot of thought over the past few weeks. I decided to coalesce my thoughts into this post. I'll start off with a pretty significant caveat. Each theory I'm putting down below is almost certainly espoused by _somebody_. But there are too many different people with different theories to in any meaningful way say "vegans believe X," for instance. Instead, consider this a high level lay of the land for these theories, and realize that there are nuances that many people will make.

In other words, this isn't even my opinion. What I'm putting below is almost a characiture of a bunch of different opinions. So take it with a grain of salt. I'll end off with my own, current-but-evolving opinion.

OK, with that out of the way, let's state a clear question: why do people become obese? There are multiple variations of this question that play in too:

* Why are people obese more often today than, says, in the 1970s, at least in the western world?
* Why are more people suffering from metabolic disorders like diabetes, chronic conditions like heart disease and cancer, and so on, at seemingly higher rates than previously?

## Calories in, calories out

This theory of obesity is arguably the simplest. At the very least, it's the one we all tend to learn from an early age, so it's most familiar. The theory is pretty simple. We consume a certain number of calories, that's called calories in (CI). That's all the food you put into your mouth. Then you have calories out (CO), which is all of the energy you expend. This can be through normal processes your body goes through to keep you alive, via explicit exercise, or even fidgeting while you're sitting at your desk reading this blog post. In theory, if you could live inside some kind of a measurement chamber, calories out would be the total amount of heat you produce through everything you do.

So why do people become obese? Because CI > CO. If you eat more than you use, your body stores the extra calories. Then you gain weight. And if you do that for long enough, constantly staying in a caloric surplus, you become overweight, and then obese.

## How much does a calorie weigh?

The first problem I want to point out about CICO is a pedantic one. This way of framing the theory makes it sound like calories weigh something. And now that I have more calories in my body, I weigh more. But (ignoring some physicist who's about to yell at me) energy doesn't actually weigh anything! A calorie doesn't have mass. When we talk about "gaining weight" from "calories," what we're _actually_ talking about is storing additional fat (or glycogen), which can later be burned to release energy.

Alright, fair enough, that seems like a little bit of a distinction without a difference. But it does have an important outcome. You never have extra "energy" circulating around your body. You have specific kinds of matter. It may be surplus glucose or triglycerides in your blood. It may be a saturated glycogen store in your liver. It may be too many visceral fat cells. Or overloaded fat cells. Or subcutaneous fat. And all of these behave differently.

OK, with that tangent addressed, let's get more substantive.

## CICO isn't a theory

As I've defined CICO above, it seems like a coherent theory with strong predictive power. In my experience, most of the disagreements and confusion come from the fact that that's not true. For example, let me state some strawman outcomes from the framing of CICO above:

1. If I measure my calories out for a week, then eat less than that, I will lose weight
2. If I'm weight stable, and I start eating more food, I will gain weight
3. If I'm weight stable, and I continue eating the same amount of food, I will stay the same weight

Those statements may seem valid, but they're definitely not. First off, there's too much ambiguity in other variables. In other words, I didn't state [ceteris paribus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus), or "other things equal." For example, in (3), if I continue eating the same amount of food, but increase my exercise to burn an extra 1,000 calories a day, most people would expect me to lose weight.

But now let's throw in a ceteris paribus. _Other things equal_. What do we mean by other things? Let's say I've clocked in eating 2,500 calories a day for the past month, and my weight has been stable. I then reduce my caloric intake to 2,000 calories a day. I continue all normal daily activities, with zero modifications. Ceteris paribus, right? We've now reduced calories in, kept calories out locked, and therefore CICO predicts weight loss.

Except that isn't true either! Keep in mind that calories out isn't simply "the total amount of exercise you do." It's based on metabolic processes, and fidgeting, and heat generation. My previous paragraph made an implicit, and perhaps wrong, assumption: I can change calories in and, by controlling all other variables in my life, leave calories out unchanged.

And here we come to the primary objection to the CICO model: **calories in and calories out are not independent variables**. And in fact, almost everyone agrees to this fact. If you massively decrease the amount of food you eat, you'll ultimately enter starvation mode and expend less energy. If you increase your food consumption, your body will seek methods of burning off&mdash;instead of storing&mdash;extra energy.

I don't remember where I first read this, but CICO is better described as a _definition_ than as a _theory_. It is not predictive of outcomes. Instead, it defines three terms and a relationship among them. Specifically: `calories in - calories out = energy delta`. If you consume 2,500 calories, and burn 3,000 calories, your energy delta is _defined_ as -500 calories. If those calories are taken from storied body fat, you'll lose approximately 56 grams of fat.

However, as soon as you move beyond CICO as a _definition_ or a _tautology_ into the realm of diet advice, _then_ you begin to enter a true realm of disagreement.

## Quick recap, then the theories

Alright, so that's a lot of theoretical nonsense, right? Let's recap, and then explore what some of the various theories are around becoming obese.

* Obesity comes from gaining weight as fat
* You gain fat by storing consumed calories (energy) as body fat
* The amount of energy you store is _defined_ as `calories in - calories out`
* If you could reduce calories in without affecting calories out, you would lose weight (or gain weight more slowly)
* However, as mentioned above and detailed below, these two variables may be intricately linked
* And therefore, changing one without changing the other may be easier said than done

OK, let's move on!

## Eat less, move more

Also known as: sloth and gluttony. I think for most people, this slogan is essentially synonymous with CICO. And this is where an unfair sleight of hand has been pulled. As I've said, most people agree with CICO as a _definition_. But the "eat less, move more" as a _prescription_ is where they begin to differ.

Eat less, move more has been the basis of common medical advice around obesity for a long time. Consume less calories, fight off the cravings, exercise more, overcome the lethargy. And you _will_ lose weight. There are a number of objections to this:

* Statistically, it seems to not be true. This advice has been pushed for decades, and obesity has gotten worse. Arguably this is due to non-compliance (because of sloth and gluttony). The counter to _that_ argument is that it doesn't matter. For _whatever_ reason, this advice hasn't produced the desired outcome at a societal level, and therefore it doesn't work. (And a counter to _that_ would be: sure, it doesn't work for everyone, but it might work for me, because I am less slothful and less gluttonous.)
* This slogan fails to explain why obesity has gotten _worse_. Have human beings suddenly become more lazy and gluttonous? Maybe. That's a big claim to make. As we'll see, there are theories that are mostly in line with the "eat less, move more" philosophy that give some explanations.
* Taken to an extreme, "eat less, move more" leads to "a calorie is a calorie." It doesn't matter if I'm eating 400 calories of white bread, 400 calories of butter, or 400 calories of high fructose corn syrup. It's all the same to the body. This is patently, and demonstrably, false. You can test it yourself, if you have the will power. Spend a week doing nothing but guzzling 2,000 calories a day of heavy whipping cream and sticks of butter. See what happens on the scale. Then spend a week eating nothing but 2,000 calories a day of broccoli. What happened on the scale that week? If you believe your body fat stores will respond to those situations differently, then you probably don't believe all calories are created equal.

## Why we eat more?

What if the choice of the food we eat impacts how much food we eat? If you were bothered by my last bullet point, you're probably already headed in that direction. With great ease, I could consume 4,000 calories a day of my favorite brand and flavor of ice cream. That combination of sugar and fat, with those delicious and unique flavors, and the incredible density of energy in that ice cream, would make those calories disappear in an instant.

4,000 calories of broccoli is another story. And I _like_ broccoli. It's just difficult to imagine consuming that much of it. Broccoli is energy sparse. It has high water content. It has fiber. And it just doesn't have the same appeal as a bowl of ice cream.

So let's move beyond "a calorie is a calorie." No, not all calories are created equal! Different food sources encourage different eating behaviors. Some kind of food causes satiety. Some kind of food encourages ravenous hunger.

Stephan Guyenet almost certainly falls into this category with [The Hungry Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Hungry-Brain-Outsmarting-Instincts-Overeat/dp/125008119X), which I've read, enjoyed, and still follow some advice from. That book analyzes hormonal signals that may trigger our brain to want to overeat. There's a lot to the theory, but to massively simplify it: our brain was built to seek carbs and fats as scarce energy resources. And in nature, you'll find them. But modern processed food slams these together into things like donuts that completely overpower our natural satiety mechanisms.

Ted Naiman and William Shewfelt take a similar kind of approach in [The P:E Diet](https://pedietbook.com/). I'm not even sure if the two camps disagree on things, or if the former is more theoretical with the latter being more instructive. I'd love to hear a discussion between Guyenet and Naiman. Essentially, in The P:E Diet, the problem is that our modern diet has insufficient protein. (Fiber and micronutrients get thrown in too, but if you follow Naiman on Twitter, protein definitely takes center stage.)

So to sum up: It's still about Calories In/Calories out. We need to reduce Calories In (and increase calories out, though that's secondary). But instead of using sheer will power to overcome gluttony, we should make food choices that encourage satiety to make it easier on ourselves.

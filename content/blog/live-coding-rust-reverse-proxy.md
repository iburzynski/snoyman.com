I've been doing quite a bit of experimenting recently with my video recording and streaming setup. As a combination of "let's test it out" and "let's see if anyone likes this kind of thing," I'm going to be doing a live coding session this Tuesday, December 29, at 10am Eastern. If everything goes according to plan (which it may not), you can [view the live stream and the recording on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ksKpx6MlMPw):

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/FcHYQMRfGWw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

I'm also planning on streaming simultaneously on Twitter via Periscope, so if you follow me on Twitter you may see it pop up there. The current plan is:

* Live code a reverse proxy using Rust and Hyper. I'm hoping to use the latest Hyper 0.14 and Tokio 1.0, which I haven't tested out yet at all.
* Make modifications in response to any chats I see (assuming I get chats to work).
* Answer any Q&A that pops up.

This first go through will likely be rocky, so if you want to come and help me out, and/or laugh at me fumbling through coding and fighting A/V issues simultaneously, come check it out!

If anyone has requests for future live streaming sessions, or Q&A they'd like to queue up in advance, please let me know in the comments below or on Twitter. I'd definitely like to do some Haskell live coding too, so I'm curious what people would like to see on that front in particular.
